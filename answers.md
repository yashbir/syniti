`Q` - What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

While working in Limetray, I created an architecture to support/create analytics products. On a high level, the architecture had Python microservices, Cassandra database, and ActiveMQ for communication. Though this doesn't sound that complex but to support the existing use cases and features for newer products it took a lot of brainstorming and deep dive. All the non-functional requirements were also expected out of this architecture, e.g.- performance, stability, resiliency.

Currently, I am building an employee management product for my friend. He has this security business in Goa and to manage all the employees he needs good cloud-based software. I also wanted to explore ReactJS, so this looked like a good opportunity to get down with it.

I was recently thinking about the distributed transactions. How should one maintain consistency in a distributed system? After coming up with a solution, I wanted to validate my idea on the internet, then I landed on this beautiful article - https://eng.uber.com/money-scale-strong-data/
Why I want others to read it? Because this article summarizes what should we consider while building a distributed payment system or any critical system, like Consistency, Idempotency, Immutability, Validation jobs, etc.

`Q` - Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one specific aspect that makes it truly great.

I love VIM. I have recently started using it more, even put Vim emulator inside Visual Studio Code. What I love about Vim is the amazing customizations, powerful actions, keyboard focus, and of course, it's FAST.
